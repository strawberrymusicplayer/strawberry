Verse 1:
This is the first line of the first verse with some long text that will wrap across multiple lines when the available width is constrained
Second line continues the story with more words to trigger wrapping behavior and test proper height calculations

Chorus:
Repeating chorus line that is quite long and should wrap nicely when displayed in narrow windows or on small screens
Another chorus line with even more text to ensure proper wrapping and height calculation across different resolutions

Verse 2:
Third verse brings more lyrics that need proper text wrapping support to display correctly on all screen sizes
The text should flow naturally and wrap at word boundaries to maintain readability
Final line of the verse completes the song with additional content for comprehensive testing
